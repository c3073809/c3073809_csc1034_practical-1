Portfolio 1
===========

This package is build as a part of the CSC1034: Portfolio-1.
The base that I am using is Panda3D. I am trying to stop the rotation of the panda using if function. Need to put 
another 3 parser argument which is scale, night mode, and panda color. After that you need to print those 
arguments to the panda.py. Scale is used for the size of the panda, night mode is for the changing the background color
behind the panda either night mode or normal mode, the panda color also changeable between normal, brown, and black. 
Also I am adding MP3 files to make the viewers feel like they are in the jungle for the real sound effects.

Type `python hello_world.py` to see some useful information.
